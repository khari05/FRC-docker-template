## FRC Docker Template
An FRC base project allowing the user to develop inside of a docker container. Taking the need out of local dependencies.

## Compiling on ARM machines
There is currently a [bug in WPILib](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/issues/3070) where it detects the arm64 OpenJDK Docker image as 32bit linux and ends up failing to find a specific file on the WPI Maven repository. The simplest solution to this issue is to make a temporary change that's listed in [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) to let it compile. This will *mostly* fix compiling. The sacrifice is that it will make the Intelisense from the Java Extension Pack no longer work.

## Prerequisites to install
